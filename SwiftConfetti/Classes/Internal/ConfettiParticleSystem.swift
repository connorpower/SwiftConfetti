 `ConfettiParticleSystem` is a SceneKit particle system which creates a
 short-lived confetti effect. It should be attached to the scene
 each time confetti should be dispensed.

 Two modes exist - `foreground` and `background`. The `foreground`
 mode dispenses confetti particles as they might be expected to look.
 The `background` mode dispenses smaller, blurred confetti particles
 which give the effect of being somewhat far away in the distance.
